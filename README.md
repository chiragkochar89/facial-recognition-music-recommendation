# 🎵 Facial Recognition Based Music Recommendation System

An AI-powered system that detects **facial emotions in real time** and recommends **music playlists based on the detected mood** using **Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Spotify API**.

---

# 📌 Project Overview

The **Facial Recognition and Music Recommendation System** integrates facial emotion detection with a music recommendation engine to provide a personalized listening experience.

The system captures facial expressions using a webcam, analyzes them using a deep learning model trained on the **FER2013 dataset**, and recommends suitable music based on the detected emotion.

This allows users to receive **dynamic music recommendations that match their mood in real time.**

---

# ❗ Problem Statement

Traditional music recommendation systems depend on **user listening history or manual selection** and cannot understand the user's **real-time emotional state**.

This project solves that problem by:

* Detecting facial expressions
* Identifying user emotions
* Recommending music that matches the detected mood

This creates a **more personalized and emotionally engaging music experience.**

---

# 🚀 Features

* 🎥 Real-time facial emotion detection
* 🎵 Emotion-based music recommendation
* 🤖 Deep learning model for emotion classification
* 🌐 Flask-based web application
* 🔗 Spotify API integration using Spotipy
* ⚡ Multi-threaded video processing for smooth performance

# ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-recognition-music-recommendation.git
```

---

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 3️⃣ Configure Spotify API

Open **Spotify.py** and add your Spotify developer credentials.

```
client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
redirect_uri = "YOUR_REDIRECT_URI"
```

Create credentials at:

https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard

---

### 4️⃣ Run the application

```
python app.py
```

Open in browser:

```
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

Allow **camera permission** when prompted.

# ⚠️ Limitations

* Emotion detection accuracy depends on lighting and camera quality
* Model accuracy may vary for different facial expressions
* Cannot be deployed directly on cloud servers due to webcam dependency

---

# 🔮 Future Improvements

* Improve emotion detection accuracy using advanced deep learning models
* Enable client-side webcam streaming for cloud deployment
* Add direct Spotify music playback
* Implement personalized recommendation learning
